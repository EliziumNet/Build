# :hammer: Elizium.Build

Common Invoke-Build build tasks used by Elizium PowerShell modules. This module allows for the centralisation of control of the build script (ie the implemented tasks can be defined in 1 place and imported by client repos). Future updates to client Elizium modules build scripts must be done via this module.

:warning: This module is for Elizium PowerShell modules only. Future updates are for the needs of Elizium modules.
